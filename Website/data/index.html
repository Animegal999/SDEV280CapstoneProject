<h1>Data From Our Ecological Survey</h1>
<div id="part1">
  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>For the purposes of this assignment, we were tasked to gather data from several people, and then compile the results of the data. The data is about how much resources each person consumes over the period of one year, and their ecological footprint, as well as their carbon footprint.</p>
  <br>
  <p>For the U.S. Students:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rowel Araman</li>
    <li>John Covaciu</li>
    <li>Amber Giza</li>
    <li>Yen Nhi Le</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the UAE Students:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Husain Albahrani</li>
    <li>Alwed Alnuaimi</li>
    <li>Marwa AlShamsi</li>
    <li>Leyan Eid</li>
    <li>Rose Hodefa</li>
    <li>Muhammad Yusupov</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>The purpose of the project is to find out a general idea of what everyone's Ecological Footprint is. Since we cannot possibly interview 8 billion different people at once, we chose a smaller sample size to represent a population, which was 120 people. We hoped to achieve a general idea of a country's overall Ecological Footprint and Number of Earths that a person from said country might use in their everyday life. With the measured results, we hope to take the next steps in reducing our Ecological Footprints.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Project Obstacles</h2>
  <p>For me, I had technical issues with using Google Colab, but thankfully, one of the group members helped collaborate with using said Jupyter Notebook. Another issue is that for the UAE students in my group, I couldn't seem to get in contact with them, despite my best efforts, because they mainly used Instagram for messaging each other. This is not a social media platform that I use, as I am not photogenic in the slightest. Thankfully, one of my group members is able to talk to the other group members, and he let's me know if there's any issues or questions that they have for me.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Implementation and Questions</h2>
  <p>For the assignment at hand, we have three questions to answer, which will be demonstrated in this website:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Are there any outliers for the Ecological Footprint (in Tonnes or as a percentage), A person's Number of Earths, use of CO2 Emissions, Carbon Footprint (as a percentage), and everyone's individual consumption in GHA graphs? ANSWER: <a href="python.html#Question1"> Yes</a></li>
    <li>What's the minimum, median, and maximum numbers of earth by country? ANSWER: <a href="excel.html#Question2">See Image of Table</a></li>
    <li>How many distinct countries are found in the data? ANSWER: <a href="sql_use.html#Question3">17 different countries that people live in, and 26 different countries people are from.</a></li>
    <li>Which Countries have the highest or lowest Ecological Footprints, between the USA and UAE, according to the data? ANSWER: <a href="sql_use.html#Question4">The United Arab Emirates has the higher Average Ecological Footprint.</a></li>
    <li>What was the most common Earth Overshoot Day for everyone? ANSWER: <a href="excel.html#Question5">March 5th</a></li>
  </ol>
  <p>These questions will be answered with the use of SQL, Excel and Python. An in-depth analysis of the code for both languages will be given - both in a written and a video format.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Improvements</h2>
  <p>If there's one thing I wish I could've improve on, it would be better communication with the UAE students, by using Instagram. I have used the app in the past, but only for following and commenting on posts, and not really as a place to post anything. However, I do feel like I could've stayed in contact better with the other members of my group.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Agile Framework</h2>
  <p>Advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Communicating with our team members in breakout rooms via Zoom helped out, especially with me, since I was usually stressed out about making sure the work I was doing was perfect.</li>
    <li>Measuring our progress with the </li>
    <li>I focused heavily on making sure the website and the data could be undersood, universally</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Disadvantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keeping things simple was a bit of a nightmare on stressful days, because I struggled with uploading my project to WebHostingForStudents and also GitHub.</li>
    <li>Trying to improve was always on my mind, which easily stressed me out.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>Interesting Aspect(s):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I was surprised that for the SQL portion of the project that I also decided to do, I could use Microsoft Access, which was a lot easier to use than PHPMyAdmin, as I would've had to painstakingly input each data point into the table. With Access, it's similar to Excel, but so it was easy to copy and paste the data into the table. I just had to update each field to have be a String, Double, Date, etc.</li>
  </ul>
